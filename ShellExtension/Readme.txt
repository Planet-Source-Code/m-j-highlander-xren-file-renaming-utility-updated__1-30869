Hi everybody!
Well, here's a nice bit of complex code- a shell extension in the form of a context menu handler. I'm actually rather pleased with it, as it was rather difficult to get som documentation on it, and what there was was pitiful.
However, I assume that since you're reading this, you want to run the program straight away? Well slow down!
A few steps before you can run it all.
1. Unzip all of the files into the one directory.
2. Register the DLL file.
3. Enter the .REG file into the registry.
4. Right click on a file, and notice the new Shell Extension!


Well, have fun. There's more comments in the module file.

Cya in there!
